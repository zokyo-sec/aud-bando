/// @notice This contract is the main entry point for users to request services from the Bando protocol.
/// @notice Considerations:
/// The router contract is intended to handle methods to deposit to the escrow cotract to request a service
/// For fulfillments being requested for payment with an ERC20 compliant token,
/// the router will call the depositERC20 method on the ERC20 escrow contract.
/// - The contract is Ownable, Pausable, UUPSUpgradeable, and ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.
/// - The owner of the contract can set the fulfillable registry, token registry, escrow, and ERC20 escrow addresses.
/// - The owner of the contract is the protocol operator.
/// - The contract is intended to be user-facing.
/// - The contract will validate the request and transfer the payment to the fulfillable contract.
/// - The contract will emit events for each service requested.
/// - The contract will emit an event if the validation of the request fails.
/// - The contract can be paused by the owner.
